# AStar-Algorithm-Visualization
This is a simple implementation of the A-Star search algorithm through the use of pygame

# Instructions
- The first click by users mouse will draw the starting point
- The second click by users mouse will draw the end point
- The following input by users mouse will draw the barriers
    - Right clicking will erase any drawn points on the grid
- Hit SPACE BAR to start search algorithm
    - Algorithm will not start if a start and end point have not been selected
- Once the algorithm is completed, the user is able to draw more barriers and restart the algorith if they so choose to
- Hit C to clear grid

# Requirements
Python 3.8.2
Pygame
