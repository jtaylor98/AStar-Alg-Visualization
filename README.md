# AStar-Algorithm-Visualization
This is a simple implementation of the A-Star search algorithm illustrated on a coordinate grid 

## Instructions
- The first click by the user's mouse will draw the starting point
- The second click by the user's mouse will draw the end point
- The following input by user's mouse will draw barriers
    - Right clicking will erase any drawn points on the grid
- Press "SPACEBAR" to start search algorithm
    - Algorithm will not start if a start and end point have not been selected
- Once the algorithm is completed, the user is able to draw more barriers and restart the algorithm if they choose to
- Press "C" to clear grid

## Requirements
- Python 3.8.2
- Pygame
